            <h1>Turing Machine</h1>
            <p> A turing machine is a hypothetical computing device, meaning it was never really meant to be built. Therorized by Alan Turing in 1936, it operates  by wirting on a infinite-lenght tape based on a set of given rules. It was made to represent the possible operation of a computign machine. As such, it is a good way to show how a modern computer "thinks"</p>
            <h1> Alan Turing </h1>
            <p> Alan Turing (June 23,1912-June 7,1954) was a computer scientist, mathmatician, phlosopher,theoretical biologist and marathon runner. His greatest contributions to the realm of computer science are the turing machine and the turing test, both of which have become seminoles ideas in computer science. Thr turing test is if a person asks a computer a question and cannot tell whather is is a person or computer then it passes. The idea was if the computer could fool a human, it was sucessfull. These idead have endured in computer science, leading Alan Turing to be called the father of computer science. As the field has become more popular, so has Alan Turing </p>
